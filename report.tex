Network Routing refers to the action of an electronic network in transferring data 
from one part of the network to another in an efficient and an optimized way. 
The Network typically consists of a bunch of forwarding elements (Hardware) which 
perform the actual transmission, receiving of data and a software sitting on top of them, 
which co-ordinate and take decisions on which next hardware element the piece of data 
should be given to. Figure~ \ref{fig:basicrouter} presents a basic structure 
of a single routing element.\\
\textbf{Quagga} is one such software, a Network Routing Software. It runs on \textit{Unix}-like systems 
(GNU/Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD). Quagga is a Software Suite, having implementations 
of the famous routing protocols of the Internet viz. \textbf{Routing Information Protocol (RIP), 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)} and also support for 
BABEL, OLSR (Wireless Mesh Routing Protocols).\\

\subsection{Architecture}
The Quagga architecture consists of a core daemon, \textit{zebra}, which acts as an abstraction 
layer to the underlying Unix kernel and presents the \textbf{Zserv API} over a Unix or TCP stream 
to Quagga clients. It is these Zserv clients which typically implement a routing protocol 
and communicate routing updates to the zebra daemon.\cite{quaggaofficial}

\subsection{Usecases}
Mention specifically who currently use quagga and for what purpose.

\section{Testbed Description}
Our goal is to display the working of the Open-Shortest-Path-First protocol, how link-state information is displayed,
how the routing table is built and how an alternate path is established in case of a link failure.
We use, two physical machines each running 12.04 Ubuntu LTS, with Intel x86-64 bit architectures with
32 GB of RAM. We run in each of these, two virtual machines which are directly connected to the host machine,
and also via an internal network between them.

  \label{fig:networktopo}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:networktopo} presents the network topology that we discussed. Each node whether a virtual or a physical
entity has Quagga running on it and functions as a router. For practical reasons, we didn't add individual nodes
but used our Router nodes for running basic connectivity and path measurements. We perform two experiments, and
further capture the connectivity and path measurements using the \textit{ping} and \textit{traceroute} commands 
available on standard Ubuntu distributions.
\subsection{Experiment 1}
In the first experiment, we simply start the Quagga routing software with a OSPF daemon on each of the nodes
and verify the routing table generated.
\subsection{Experiment 2}
Tear down a link and display how packets are re-routed along with the new routing table

\section{Performance Measurement Results}
This section will display the ping graphics and the traceroute graphics for both experiment 1 and experiment 2

\section{Conclusions and Suggestions}
This section needs to talk about what use-case we solved by using quagga and what we learnt using Quagga
Also, if we have any feedback for this assignment we can give it here.
