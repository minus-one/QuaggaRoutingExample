\section{OSPF}
Do we need this???

\section{Testbed Description}
This section will describe our experiment, what we intend to do
\subsection{Experiment 1}
Set up of OSPF showing how the routing table is created
\subsection{Experiment 2}
Tear down a link and display how packets are re-routed along with the new routing table
\clearpage
\section{Performance Measurement Results}
This section will display the ping graphics and the traceroute graphics for both experiment 1 and experiment 2
\subsection{Experiment 1}
\subsection{Experiement 2}

\section{Conclusions and Suggestions}
This section needs to talk about what use-case we solved by using quagga and what we learnt using Quagga
Also, if we have any feedback for this assignment we can give it here.
